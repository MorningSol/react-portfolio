# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Description
Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

I have created a portfolio using my new React skills which will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.
